# group_project_neja
This group project involved creating a mock business project and then generating the number 
of workers with appropriate skills of appropriate amount to complete said project. The project was initiated
client side on the DOM, and project requirements created server side. Randomly generated employees to complete
the project were generated server-side. There was to be a button on the DOM to create another randomly 
generated employee. 

Overall, this project involved the use of both client-side and server-side logic and calls from the client 
to the server.
